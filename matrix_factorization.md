Data Collection:
  Data must either be assembled as a list of lists of song ratings such that each list represents
  that user's ratings of each song, in order, comma delimited.
                                    OR
  Data can be presented in a .xlsx such as that generated by Google Forms,
  such that each row is a user and each column is a song - row 3, col 10 would give
  user 4's rating of song 11.

  In this case, the data will have to be read and converted by calling excel_to_matrix(fp)
  where fp is the filepath of the excel file such as "jeremycohen/Fall2020/CS4100/song_data.xlsx"

Cleaning Data:
  Next, depending on how clean the data is, you may want to remove duplicate entries by calling
  rm_duplicates(song_ratings) where song_ratings is the list of lists of song ratings.

  It also may be useful to define a song_index as the list of songs in the dataset so that
  the recommendations method can return the titles of the songs. This list can be built using
  the excel_to_matrix method on a filepath to an .xlsx file with the song titles, in order.

  You also may want to specify a minimum threshold of ratings on a given song,
  below which the song is deemed too unknown for it to be meaningfully included in the data.
  This is done by calling remove_losers(song_ratings, threshold):
    # song_ratings: list of lists of song ratings
    # threshold: [0-1] percentage of users that must not know a song for it to be removed

Running:
  Once the data (song_ratings) is defined (list of lists of [1-5] ratings), we can generate
  the model's predictions for every user-song datapoint (including those songs which have
  already been rated by that user) by assigning:
    gen_scores = generate_scores(song_ratings)
      # song_ratings : the list of lists of song ratings

  To produce recommendations for a given user, simply call:
    recommendations(song_ratings, gen_scores, ID)
      # song_ratings: the list of lists of song ratings,
      # gen_scores: the output of calling generate_scores(song_ratings)
      # ID: the ID number of the user to make recommendations for.
